    <h1>Earth</h1>
    <p>Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to harbor life.
        While large volumes of water can be found throughout the Solar System, only Earth sustains liquid surface water.
         About 71% of Earth's surface is made up of the ocean, dwarfing Earth's polar ice, lakes, and rivers. 
         The remaining 29% of Earth's surface is land, consisting of continents and islands. 
         Earth's surface layer is formed of several slowly moving tectonic plates, interacting to produce mountain ranges, 
         volcanoes, and earthquakes. Earth's liquid outer core generates the magnetic field that shapes Earth's magnetosphere,
        deflecting destructive solar winds.

   <h2>Etymology & Chronology</h2>
   <p>The modern English word Earth developed, via Middle English, from an Old English noun most often spelled eorðe.[26]
     It has cognates in every Germanic language, and their ancestral root has been reconstructed as *erþō. 
     In its earliest attestation, the word eorðe was already being used to translate the many senses of Latin terra and Greek γῆ gē: 
     the ground, its soil, dry land, the human world, the surface of the world (including the sea), and the globe itself.
      As with Roman Terra/Tellūs and Greek Gaia, Earth may have been a personified goddess in Germanic paganism: 
      late Norse mythology included Jörð ('Earth'), a giantess often given as the mother of Thor.
    
      The oldest material found in the Solar System is dated to 4.5682+0.0002
      −0.0004 Ga (billion years) ago.[37] By 4.54±0.04 Ga the primordial Earth had formed.[38]
       The bodies in the Solar System formed and evolved with the Sun. 
       In theory, a solar nebula partitions a volume out of a molecular cloud by gravitational collapse,
        which begins to spin and flatten into a circumstellar disk, and then the planets grow out of that disk with the Sun.
        A nebula contains gas, ice grains, and dust (including primordial nuclides). 
        According to nebular theory, planetesimals formed by accretion, 
        with the primordial Earth being estimated as likely taking anywhere from 70 to 100 million years to form.</p>

    <h3>origin of life and revolution</h3>
    <p>Chemical reactions led to the first self-replicating molecules about four billion years ago.
         A half billion years later, the last common ancestor of all current life arose.[61] 
         The evolution of photosynthesis allowed the Sun's energy to be harvested directly by life forms. 
         The resultant molecular oxygen (O2) accumulated in the atmosphere and due to interaction with ultraviolet solar radiation, 
         formed a protective ozone layer (O3) in the upper atmosphere.[62] 
         The incorporation of smaller cells within larger ones resulted in the development of complex cells called eukaryotes.[63] 
         True multicellular organisms formed as cells within colonies became increasingly specialized. 
         Aided by the absorption of harmful ultraviolet radiation by the ozone layer, life colonized Earth's surface.[64] 
         Among the earliest fossil evidence for life is microbial mat fossils found in 3.48 billion-year-old sandstone 
         in Western Australia,[65] biogenic graphite found in 3.7 billion-year-old metasedimentary rocks in Western Greenland,[66]
          and remains of biotic material found in 4.1 billion-year-old rocks in Western Australia.[67][68] 
          The earliest direct evidence of life on Earth is contained in 3.45 billion-year-old Australian 
          rocks showing fossils of microorganisms.[69][70]</p>
