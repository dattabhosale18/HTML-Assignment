                        <p>The universe (Latin: universus) is all of space and time[a] and their contents,[10]
                           including planets, stars, galaxies, and all other forms of matter and energy. 
                           The Big Bang theory is the prevailing cosmological description of the development of the universe. 
                           According to this theory, space and time emerged together 13.787±0.020 billion years ago,[11] 
                           and the universe has been expanding ever since the Big Bang. 
                           While the spatial size of the entire universe is unknown,[3] it is possible to measure the size of the 
                           observable universe, which is approximately 93 billion light-years in diameter at the present day.</p>

                        <p>The Milky Way[b] is the galaxy that includes our Solar System, with the name describing the galaxy's 
                           appearance from Earth: a hazy band of light seen in the night sky formed from stars that cannot be
                           individually distinguished by the naked eye. The term Milky Way is a translation of the Latin via lactea, 
                           from the Greek γαλακτικός κύκλος (galaktikos kýklos), meaning "milky circle."[21][22][23] From Earth, 
                           the Milky Way appears as a band because its disk-shaped structure is viewed from within. 
                           Galileo Galilei first resolved the band of light into individual stars with his telescope in 1610. 
                           Until the early 1920s, most astronomers thought that the Milky Way contained all the stars 
                           in the Universe.[24] Following the 1920 Great Debate between the astronomers Harlow Shapley and 
                           Heber Curtis,[25] observations by Edwin Hubble showed that the Milky Way is just one of many galaxies.</p>

                        <p>A planet is a large, rounded astronomical body that is neither a star nor its remnant. 
                            The best available theory of planet formation is the nebular hypothesis, which posits that an 
                            interstellar cloud collapses out of a nebula to create a young protostar orbited by a protoplanetary disk. 
                            Planets grow in this disk by the gradual accumulation of material driven by gravity, 
                            a process called accretion. The Solar System has at least eight planets: the terrestrial planets Mercury, 
                            Venus, Earth and Mars, and the giant planets Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. </p>

                        <p>Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to harbor life. 
                           While large volumes of water can be found throughout the Solar System, only Earth sustains liquid 
                           surface water. About 71% of Earth's surface is made up of the ocean, dwarfing Earth's polar ice, lakes, 
                           and rivers. The remaining 29% of Earth's surface is land, consisting of continents and islands. 
                           Earth's surface layer is formed of several slowly moving tectonic plates, interacting to produce 
                           mountain ranges, volcanoes, and earthquakes. Earth's liquid outer core generates the magnetic field that 
                           shapes Earth's magnetosphere, deflecting destructive solar winds.</p>
