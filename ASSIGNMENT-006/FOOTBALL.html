        <h3>Football</h3>
        Football is a family of team sports that involve, to varying degrees, kicking a ball to score a goal. Unqualified, 
        the word football normally means the form of football that is the most popular where the word is used. Sports commonly called football 
        include association football (known as soccer in North America and Oceania); gridiron football (specifically American football or Canadian football); 
        Australian rules football; rugby union and rugby league; and Gaelic football.[1] These various forms of football share to varying extent common origins 
        and are known as football codes.

        <h4>Laws of the game</h4>
        There are 17 laws in the official Laws of the Game, each containing a collection of stipulation and guidelines. The same laws are designed to apply to 
        all levels of football, although certain modifications for groups such as juniors, seniors, women and people with physical disabilities are permitted. 
        The laws are often framed in broad terms, which allow flexibility in their application depending on the nature of the game. The Laws of the Game are 
        published by FIFA, but are maintained by the International Football Association Board (IFAB).[79] In addition to the seventeen laws, numerous IFAB decisions 
        and other directives contribute to the regulation of football.[80][81]
